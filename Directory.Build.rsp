# ================================================================================
# Response (.rsp) files are text files that contain MSBuild.exe command-line switches.
# Each switch can be on a separate line or all switches can be on one line.
# Comment lines are prefaced with a # symbol.
# The @ switch is used to pass another response file to MSBuild.exe.
# See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-command-line-reference#switches

# Show detailed information at the end of the build log about the configurations that were built and how they were scheduled to nodes.
-ds

# Specifies the maximum number of concurrent processes to use when building.
# If you don't include this switch, the default value is 1.
# If you include this switch without specifying a value, MSBuild will use up to the number of processors in the computer.
# See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/building-multiple-projects-in-parallel-with-msbuild
-m

# Set or override the specified project-level properties, where name is the property name and value is the property value.
# Specify each property separately, or use a semicolon or comma to separate multiple properties.
-p:Configuration=Debug

# Runs the Restore target prior to building the actual targets.
-restore

# Build the specified targets in the project.
# Specify each target separately, or use a semicolon or comma to separate multiple targets.
-target:Build

# Validate the project file and, if validation succeeds, build the project.
# If you don't specify schema, the project is validated against the default schema.
# If you specify schema, the project is validated against the schema that you specify.
# The following setting is an example: -validate:MyExtendedBuildSchema.xsd
-validate

# Specifies the amount of information to display in the build log.
# Each logger displays events based on the verbosity level that you set for that logger.
# -verbosity:quiet
# -verbosity:minimal
-verbosity:normal
# -verbosity:detailed
# -verbosity:diagnostic

# Insert command-line switches from a text file.
# If you have multiple files, you specify them separately.
